Create a directory where creating and testing the recipe.

mkdir /home/vidal/wkg/yocto/myhdl_recipe
I download several repoistories to the location below.

rsync -avl ../repo072015/poky .
The above command will put poky to clean location

cd poky

git checkout -b fido
Switched to a new branch 'fido'

. oe-init-build-env

 recipetool create  -o /home/vidal/wkg/yocto/myhdl_recipe/poky/meta/recipes-devtools/python/python-myhdl_1.0.0.bb  git://github.com/jandecaluwe/myhdl.git

The recipe template will be created including some information about the file fetched.
 
  
I added my local.conf with #DL_DIR ?= "/home/vidal/wkg/yocto/downloads"
to download to /home/vidal/wkg/yocto/myhdl_recipe/poky/build/downloads
