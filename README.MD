These are the files for creating an image for the raspberrypi2
using Yocto.  The fido branch of poky, meta-raspberrypi, and meta-oe
were used.  
This was started on 07/20/15 with infomation found at 
http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/02/27/yocto-project-raspberry-pi-2-board-minimal-image/
The above provides information to create rpi-basic-image with yocto.
Thanks to Gary Thomas and the yocto mailing list I was able to get the
core-image-sato working,
07/28/15
This image now supports OpenCV using 2 C920 cameras.
