+# Parallelism Options
+#
+# These two options control how much parallelism BitBake should use. The first 
+# option determines how many tasks bitbake should run in parallel:
+#
+BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "6"
+# 
+# The second option controls how many processes make should run in parallel when

+#
+PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 6"
+#
+# For a quad-core machine, BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4", PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4" would
+# be appropriate for example.
+
+#
+
+#
+# Machine Selection
+#
+# You need to select a specific machine to target the build with. There are a selection
+# of emulated machines available which can boot and run in the QEMU emulator:
+#
+#MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
+#MACHINE ?= "qemuarm64"
+#MACHINE ?= "qemumips"
+#MACHINE ?= "qemuppc"
+#MACHINE ?= "qemux86"

+#MACHINE ?= "genericx86-64"
+#MACHINE ?= "mpc8315e-rdb"
+#MACHINE ?= "edgerouter"

+# This sets the default machine to be qemux86 if no other machine is selected:
+#MACHINE ??= "qemux86"
+#MACHINE = "raspberrypi2"
+MACHINE ??= "raspberrypi2"
+GPU_MEM = "16"
+
+#
+# Where to place downloads
+#
+# During a first build the system will download many different source code tarballs
+# from various upstream projects. This can take a while, particularly if your network
+# connection is slow. These are all stored in DL_DIR. When wiping and rebuilding you
+# can preserve this directory to speed up this part of subsequent builds. This directory
+# is safe to share between multiple builds on the same machine too.
+#
+# The default is a downloads directory under TOPDIR which is the build directory.
+#
+#DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/downloads"
+DL_DIR ?= "/home/vidal/wkg/yocto/downloads"
+#
+# Where to place shared-state files
+#
+# BitBake has the capability to accelerate builds based on previously built output.
+# This is done using "shared state" files which can be thought of as cache objects
+# and this option determines where those files are placed.
+#
+# You can wipe out TMPDIR leaving this directory intact and the build would regenerate
+# from these files if no changes were made to the configuration. If changes were made
+# to the configuration, only shared state files where the state was still valid would
+# be used (done using checksums).
+#
+# The default is a sstate-cache directory under TOPDIR.
+#
+#SSTATE_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/sstate-cache"
+
+#
+# Where to place the build output
+#
+# This option specifies where the bulk of the building work should be done and
+# where BitBake should place its temporary files and output. Keep in mind that
+# this includes the extraction and compilation of many applications and the toolchain
+# which can use Gigabytes of hard disk space.
+#
+# The default is a tmp directory under TOPDIR.
+#
+#TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp"
+
+#
+# Default policy config
+#
+# The distribution setting controls which policy settings are used as defaults.
+# The default value is fine for general Yocto project use, at least initially.
+# Ultimately when creating custom policy, people will likely end up subclassing 
+# these defaults.
+#
+DISTRO ?= "poky"
+# As an example of a subclass there is a "bleeding" edge policy configuration
+# where many versions are set to the absolute latest code from the upstream 
+# source control systems. This is just mentioned here as an example, its not
+# useful to most new users.
+# DISTRO ?= "poky-bleeding"
+
+#
+# Package Management configuration
+#
+# This variable lists which packaging formats to enable. Multiple package backends 
+# can be enabled at once and the first item listed in the variable will be used 
+# to generate the root filesystems.
+# Options are:
+#  - 'package_deb' for debian style deb files
+#  - 'package_ipk' for ipk files are used by opkg (a debian style embedded package manager)
+#  - 'package_rpm' for rpm style packages
+# E.g.: PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm package_deb package_ipk"
+# We default to rpm:
+PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm"
+
+#
+# SDK/ADT target architecture
+#
+# This variable specifies the architecture to build SDK/ADT items for and means
+# you can build the SDK packages for architectures other than the machine you are 
+# running the build on (i.e. building i686 packages on an x86_64 host).
+# Supported values are i686 and x86_64
+#SDKMACHINE ?= "i686"
+
+#
+# Extra image configuration defaults
+#
+# The EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES variable allows extra packages to be added to the generated 
+# images. Some of these options are added to certain image types automatically. The
+# variable can contain the following options:
+#  "dbg-pkgs"       - add -dbg packages for all installed packages
+#                     (adds symbol information for debugging/profiling)
+#  "dev-pkgs"       - add -dev packages for all installed packages
+#                     (useful if you want to develop against libs in the image)
+#  "ptest-pkgs"     - add -ptest packages for all ptest-enabled packages
+#                     (useful if you want to run the package test suites)
+#  "tools-sdk"      - add development tools (gcc, make, pkgconfig etc.)
+#  "tools-debug"    - add debugging tools (gdb, strace)
+#  "eclipse-debug"  - add Eclipse remote debugging support
+#  "tools-profile"  - add profiling tools (oprofile, exmap, lttng, valgrind)
+#  "tools-testapps" - add useful testing tools (ts_print, aplay, arecord etc.)
+#  "debug-tweaks"   - make an image suitable for development
+#                     e.g. ssh root access has a blank password
+# There are other application targets that can be used here too, see
+# meta/classes/image.bbclass and meta/classes/core-image.bbclass for more details.
+# We default to enabling the debugging tweaks.
+EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks dev-pkgs tools-sdk doc-pkgs"

+#
+# Additional image features
+#
+# The following is a list of additional classes to use when building images which
+# enable extra features. Some available options which can be included in this variable 
+# are:
+#   - 'buildstats' collect build statistics
+#   - 'image-mklibs' to reduce shared library files size for an image
+#   - 'image-prelink' in order to prelink the filesystem image
+#   - 'image-swab' to perform host system intrusion detection
+# NOTE: if listing mklibs & prelink both, then make sure mklibs is before prelink
+# NOTE: mklibs also needs to be explicitly enabled for a given image, see local.conf.extended
+USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"
+
+#
+# Runtime testing of images
+#
+# The build system can test booting virtual machine images under qemu (an emulator)
+# after any root filesystems are created and run tests against those images. To
+# enable this uncomment this line. See classes/testimage(-auto).bbclass for
+# further details.
+#TEST_IMAGE = "1"
+#
+# Interactive shell configuration
+#
+# Under certain circumstances the system may need input from you and to do this it 
+# can launch an interactive shell. It needs to do this since the build is 
+# multithreaded and needs to be able to handle the case where more than one parallel
+# process may require the user's attention. The default is iterate over the available
+# terminal types to find one that works.
+#
+# Examples of the occasions this may happen are when resolving patches which cannot
+# be applied, to use the devshell or the kernel menuconfig
+#
+# Supported values are auto, gnome, xfce, rxvt, screen, konsole (KDE 3.x only), none
+# Note: currently, Konsole support only works for KDE 3.x due to the way
+# newer Konsole versions behave
+#OE_TERMINAL = "auto"
+# By default disable interactive patch resolution (tasks will just fail instead):
+PATCHRESOLVE = "noop"

+# Disk Space Monitoring during the build
+#
+# Monitor the disk space during the build. If there is less that 1GB of space or less
+# than 100K inodes in any key build location (TMPDIR, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR), gracefully
+# shutdown the build. If there is less that 100MB or 1K inodes, perform a hard abort
+# of the build. The reason for this is that running completely out of space can corrupt
+# files and damages the build in ways which may not be easily recoverable.

+# Shared-state files from other locations
+#
+# As mentioned above, shared state files are prebuilt cache data objects which can 
+# used to accelerate build time. This variable can be used to configure the system
+# to search other mirror locations for these objects before it builds the data itself.
+#
+# This can be a filesystem directory, or a remote url such as http or ftp. These
+# would contain the sstate-cache results from previous builds (possibly from other 
+# machines). This variable works like fetcher MIRRORS/PREMIRRORS and points to the 
+# cache locations to check for the shared objects.
+# NOTE: if the mirror uses the same structure as SSTATE_DIR, you need to add PATH
+# at the end as shown in the examples below. This will be substituted with the
+# correct path within the directory structure.

+# Qemu configuration
