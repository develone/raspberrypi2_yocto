I tried this same code on my Ubuntu 15.04 desktop and it looks
like they've disabled it in the main python http[s] code - there
were no certificates examined during the transaction as far as
I could tell (strace is my friend)

I'll see if I can figure out how to stitch this together with our
[Poky/Yocto/OE-core] setup for OpenSSL and ca-certificates.
