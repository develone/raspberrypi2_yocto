/usr/bin/opj_decompress -h

This is the opj_decompress utility from the OpenJPEG project.
It decompresses JPEG 2000 codestreams to various image formats.
It has been compiled against openjp2 library v2.1.0.

Parameters:
-----------

  -ImgDir <directory> 
	Image file Directory path 
  -OutFor <PBM|PGM|PPM|PNM|PAM|PGX|PNG|BMP|TIF|RAW|RAWL|TGA>
    REQUIRED only if -ImgDir is used
	Output format for decompressed images.
  -i <compressed file>
    REQUIRED only if an Input image directory is not specified
    Currently accepts J2K-files, JP2-files and JPT-files. The file type
    is identified based on its suffix.
  -o <decompressed file>
    REQUIRED
    Currently accepts formats specified above (see OutFor option)
    Binary data is written to the file (not ascii). If a PGX
    filename is given, there will be as many output files as there are
    components: an indice starting from 0 will then be appended to the
    output filename, just before the "pgx" extension. If a PGM filename
    is given and there are more than one component, only the first component
    will be written to the file.
  -r <reduce factor>
    Set the number of highest resolution levels to be discarded. The
    image resolution is effectively divided by 2 to the power of the
    number of discarded levels. The reduce factor is limited by the
    smallest total number of decomposition levels among tiles.
  -l <number of quality layers to decode>
    Set the maximum number of quality layers to decode. If there are
    less quality layers than the specified number, all the quality layers
    are decoded.
  -x  
    Create an index file *.Idx (-x index_name.Idx) 
  -d <x0,y0,x1,y1>
    OPTIONAL
    Decoding area
    By default all the image is decoded.
  -t <tile_number>
    OPTIONAL
    Set the tile number of the decoded tile. Follow the JPEG2000 convention from left-up to bottom-up
    By default all tiles are decoded.
