    core-image-lsb-sdk: use kernel-devsrc to ensure kernel module builds work
    
    With the move of the kernel source to the kernel-devsrc, we need this packag
    ensure the kernel module sanity tests made on core-image-lsb-sdk continue to
    pass. Therefore update the name of the package included in the image.

    wiringpi: Bump SRCREV
    
    Update wiringpi to latest revision. Due to a refactoring of the build
    procedure in wiringpi the integration patch 'makefile-install.patch'
    didn't apply anymore. While migrating that patch it was simplified and
    generated using 'git format-patch' instead, to make it easier to maintain
    the patch in the future.
